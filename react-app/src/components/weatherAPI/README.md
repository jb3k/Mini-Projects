## Summary

* For this project I used two API calls: 
1) OpenWeatherAPI - to get weather
2) GeoDBCities - to get location
* To use the website, simply enter in a city of your choosing and the website will display that cities temperature and the forecast for the next week. 
* I downloaded two packages: 
1) npm react-accessible-accordion
2) npm react-select-async-paginate


## GeoDB Cities
* GeoDB was primarily used to get the location of where I wanted to get the weather of.

* Once adding this onto a separate file, I exported these variables to create the search function.
